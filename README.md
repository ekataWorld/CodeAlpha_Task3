ðŸ“Œ Project Name:
 "Chatbot using Python"
 
 ðŸ§  Project Overview:
This project is a simple console-based chatbot developed using Python. It responds to basic user inputs like greetings and questions with predefined replies. The chatbot runs continuously until the user types "bye", demonstrating a basic interactive communication loop.
It simulates human-like responses in a minimal yet effective way â€” perfect for beginners learning how logic flows in Python.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
â€¢	 Greets the user â€“ Responds to 'hello' or 'hi' with a friendly message
â€¢	 Mood response â€“ Replies to 'how are you' politely
â€¢	 Bot identity â€“ Answers 'what is your name' with a custom bot name
â€¢	 Exit mechanism â€“ Says goodbye when user types 'bye'
â€¢	 Default response â€“ If input not recognized, gives a fallback message


ðŸ§° Python Concepts Used:
â€¢	while True loop â€“ Keeps the chatbot running until 'bye' is entered
â€¢	input() / print() â€“ Manages user interaction through the terminal
â€¢	.lower() function â€“ Makes input case-insensitive
â€¢	if-elif-else â€“ Checks input and matches it with predefined responses
â€¢	 Functions â€“ The get_response() function modularizes the response logic

âœ… Conclusion:
This chatbot project helped me understand how to use basic Python concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals. It was easy to build and fun to test. Although it only answers a few fixed questions, it shows how chatbots work in a simple way.
